# sweep.py! #

## the most fun you can have in a day! ##

this is basically just because i already made this in java, and have been getting back into python, and figure i can do it better! 

I intend to make a fully featured minesweeper clone, maybe even add high scores! (oh that would be cool!)

i will soon be adding in arguments so you can change board size easily, but right now the game doesnt even really work, so lets not get that far.

download the file, put it in your folder of choice `$cd /folder/of/choice` (`> cd C:\\folder\\of\\choice` for Windows) and run `python sweep.py` and play around!

### WARNING: ###

this game doesnt actually work, i dont have it do anything when you lose yet, and there are no win conditions.

It'll originally work solely in the CLI, but i hope to get a grasp of PyQt and addd a GUI! that would be good fun.

## Requirements: ##

- Python 2.7 (not sure about past releases.)
   
   -- Dont complain about no python 3 support, when linuxmint(debian) ships python 3 by default, then i will switch.

- Swag

   -- Extra swag actually.

- There are no external dependencies other than python itself. have a nice day!
